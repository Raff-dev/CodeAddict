### Why this technology?
* #### Framework - Django REST framework
   Django REST framework is a powerfull and flexible toolkit for building Web API's. It Allows you to develop your backend much quicker than most of the other technologies, and most importantly in a clean and tidy manner. It is the framework i'am most fammiliar with, and hand it has one of the best and most transparent documentation I have ever encountered.
   
* #### Authentication - Simple JWT
   Simple JWT is a Django REST framework package providing a JSON Web Token authentication backend. It covers the most common use cases of JWTs by offering a conservative set of default features. JSON Web Token is a new standard which can be used for token-based authentication, which is fairly easy to implement.
   
* #### Version-control - Github desktop
  GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. Other GitHub users can review your code and propose changes. Github desktop provides an user friendly graphical interface for the git version-control system. It has just enough functionalities and as much control over a project as it is needed for such a small project like this one.
